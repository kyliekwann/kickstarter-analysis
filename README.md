# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analysis performance based on Kickstarter Campaign data
## Overview of Project
While having the opportunity to collaborate with my class peers in addition to going through the Module 1 lessons, I was able to solidify basic skills and my comfortability witin Excel. By using data from a real life scenario, Lousie's Kickstarter Campaign, beginner analysts start comprehending and analyzing data through a professional viewpoint. Conditioning our skills throughout the lesson allows for mistakes and gradual habit learning with links of code and chart-making, which leads to the finalize use of the skills that have been built up to help Lousie determine Theater outcomes and the subcategories that may impact the theater's final success. As we continue to learn more in-depth concepts and techniques, it's especially important to build habitual and knowledge behind the basic skills within coding and the use of Excel which this project does. Not only does the Module 1 Challenge allow for skill practice, but also growth within widening analytical procedure that is required when learning to become a data analyst. 
## Analysis and Challenges
As the dataset is single-handedly given to me, the repetition of coding links and chart-making easily opens opportunity for minor mistakes that may occur within the process. A reoccurring issue that had happened was simply using wrong orders of code and being able to updo them. With continuous tasks to finish, there was a long process within trying to solve the small mistake that had been creating a wrongfully represented data image but there was nothing practice couldn't fix. In regards to links to code, it takes a couple of tries to be able to stabilize the success of each code and learning the tactics that comes with stacking codes and guiding them throughout the dataset. After being able to finalize the data images and coding links, the simple process of analyzing the data and configuring observations between the similarities and differences through visual representation led to possible positive impacts to the theater outcomes that may occur. While comparing over 4000 categories of data, it was much simpler to use a chart and simplifying coding links to conclude future improvements to Lousie's theater analysis. 
## Results
Through simple observations that are easily detected through the dataset that represents the theater outcomes based on launch dates, there were a variety of different components that allowed for obvious conclusions. To begin with, there were no darastic differences or changes within the "Canceled" and "Failed" category, meaning there wasn't much to analyze as launch dates did not determine the kind of outcomes that were going to come from theaters. One analytical data piece in the image is the sudden increase from April to May, which many reasons can lead to the outburst of outcomes. While May is typically the beginning of summer break for students, there might be a contribution these two factors as they lead to a wider availability that may come with going to the theaters. This season conclusion can also be explained through the sudden drop of temperature and business that occurs from September to December. Overall, May remains to be the peaking data piece within the theater outcomes which can be a beneficial piece of data for theater owners. ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98571495/153808497-fa63feed-4761-46ab-b7a7-48af7312e8f8.png)
