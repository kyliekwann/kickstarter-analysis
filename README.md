Analysis performance based on Kickstarter Campaign data
## Overview of Project
While having the opportunity to collaborate with my class peers in addition to going through the Module 1 lessons, I was able to solidify basic skills and my comfortability witin Excel. By using data from a real life scenario, Lousie's Kickstarter Campaign, beginner analysts start comprehending and analyzing data through a professional viewpoint. Conditioning our skills throughout the lesson allows for mistakes and gradual habit learning with links of code and chart-making, which leads to the finalize use of the skills that have been built up to help Lousie determine Theater outcomes and the subcategories that may impact the theater's final success. As we continue to learn more in-depth concepts and techniques, it's especially important to build habitual and knowledge behind the basic skills within coding and the use of Excel which this project does. Not only does the Module 1 Challenge allow for skill practice, but also growth within widening analytical procedure that is required when learning to become a data analyst.
